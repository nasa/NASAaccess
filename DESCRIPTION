Description: A tool to generate gridded ascii tables and station files needed by SWAT or any other hydrological model for weather and climate inputs. The package assumes that users have already set up a registration account(s) with Earthdata login as well as authorizing NASA GES DISC data access. 
              Please refer to  <https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access> for further details. The package relies on 'curl' <https://curl.se/> commands and library to access NASA remote sensing servers.  
              Users should make sure that their local machines have 'curl' installed properly.  Instructions on creating the ".netrc" and ".urs_cookies" files can be accessed at <https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Access+Data+With+cURL+And+Wget>. 
              Creating the ".netrc" file at the user machine 'Home' directory and storing the NASA GES DISC user logging information in it is needed to execute the package commands.

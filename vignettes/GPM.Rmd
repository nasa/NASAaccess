_NASAaccess_ package has multiple functions such as `GPM_NRT`, `GPMpolyCentroid` and `GPMswat` that download, extract, and reformat rainfall remote sensing data of [TRMM](https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/trmm) and [IMERG](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) from [NASA servers](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/directory) for grids within a specified watershed shapefile. The difference between `GPM_NRT` and `GPMswat` functions is the latency period. The `GPMswat` function retrieves the [IMERG](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) Final Run data which is intended for research quality global multi-satellite precipitation estimates with quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation, gauge data, and climatological adjustment. On the other hand, the `GPM_NRT` function retrieves the [IMERG](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) near real-time low-latency gridded global multi-satellite precipitation estimates.

Let's explore `GPMpolyCentroid` and `GPMswat` functions.
## Basic use

Let's look at an example watershed that we want to examine near Houston, TX:
```{r}
library(ggmap)
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)
library(rgdal)

#Reading input data
dem_path <- system.file("extdata", 
                        "DEM_TX.tif", 
                        package = "NASAaccess")

shape_path <- system.file("extdata", 
                          "basin.shp", 
                          package = "NASAaccess")


dem <- raster(dem_path)



shape <- readOGR(shape_path)
shape.df <- ggplot2::fortify(shape)





#plot the watershed data
myMap <- get_stamenmap(bbox = c(left = -96,
                                bottom = 29.7,
                                right = -95.2,
                                top = 30),
                                            maptype = "terrain", 
                                            crop = TRUE,
                                             zoom = 10)


ggmap(myMap) +
  geom_polygon(data = shape.df, 
               aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
               fill = NA, size = 0.5, color = 'red')

```


The geographic layout of the White Oak Bayou watershed example used in this demonstration is depicted above. Whiteoak Bayou is a tributary for the Buffalo Bayou River (Harris County, Texas). In order to use _NASAaccess_ we also need a digital elevation model (DEM) raster layer. Let's see the White Oak Bayou watershed DEM and a more closer look at the study watershed example.


```{r}
# create a plot of our DEM raster along with watershed

plot(dem,
     main="White Oak Bayou Watershed with Digital Elevation Model (DEM)", 
      col=rev(bpy.colors()), 
      xlab='lon', 
      ylab='lat',
      legend  = T,
      legend.args=list(text='Elevation (m)', 
                       side=4, 
                       font=2, 
                       line=2.5, 
                       cex=0.8))

plot(shape , add = TRUE)

```


Now, let's examine `GPMswat`:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(NASAaccess)

GPMswat(Dir = "./GPMswat/",
                  watershed = shape_path,
                  DEM = dem_path,
                  start = "2020-08-1",
                  end = "2020-08-3")
```


Examining the rainfall station file generated by `GPMswat`

```{r}
GPMswat.precipitationMaster <- system.file('extdata/GPMswat',
                                         'precipitationMaster.txt', 
                                         package = 'NASAaccess')

#Reading GPMswat header file
GPMswat.table<-read.csv(GPMswat.precipitationMaster)


head(GPMswat.table)

dim(GPMswat.table)
```

`GPMswat` generated ascii table for each available grid located within the study watershed. There are 11 grids within the study watershed and that means 11 tables have been generated. `GPMswat` also generated the rainfall stations file input shown above *GPMswat.table* (table with columns: ID, File NAME, LAT, LONG, and ELEVATION) for those selected grids that fall within the specified watershed.


Now, let's see the location of these generated grid points:

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = shape.df,
          aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
          fill = NA, 
          colour = 'red') +
  geom_point(data=GPMswat.table,
             aes(x=LONG,
                 y=LAT,
                 fill=ELEVATION), 
             shape=21, 
             size = 4) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = terrain.colors(7))

```


We note here that `GPMswat` has given us all the [GPM](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) data grids that fall within the boundaries of the White Oak Bayou study watershed.

The time series rainfall data stored in the data tables (i.e., 11 tables) can be viewed also.
looking at reformatted data from the first grid point as listed in the rainfall station file generated by `GPMswat`

```{r}
GPMswat.point.data <- system.file('extdata/GPMswat',
                              'precipitation2160842.txt', 
                              package = 'NASAaccess')

#Reading data records
read.csv(GPMswat.point.data)


```

The `GPMswat` has generated a ready format ascii tables that can be ingested easily to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool [SWAT](https://swat.tamu.edu/) model or any other hydrological model of choice.



Now, let's examine `GPMpolyCentroid`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
GPMpolyCentroid(Dir = "./GPMpolyCentroid/",
                  watershed = shape_path,
                  DEM = dem_path,
                  start = "2019-08-1",
                  end = "2019-08-3")
```


Examining the rainfall station file generated by `GPMpolyCentroid`

```{r}

GPMpolyCentroid.precipitationMaster <- system.file('extdata/GPMpolyCentroid',
                                                    'precipitationMaster.txt', 
                                                    package = 'NASAaccess')

GPMpolyCentroid.precipitation.table <- read.csv(GPMpolyCentroid.precipitationMaster)

#plotting
ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = shape.df, 
               aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = NA, 
               colour = 'red') +
  geom_point(data=GPMpolyCentroid.precipitation.table,
             aes(x=LONG,y=LAT))
```


We note here that `GPMpolyCentroid` has given us the [GPM](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) data grid that falls within a specified watershed and assigns a pseudo rainfall gauge located at the centroid of the watershed a weighted-average daily rainfall data. 

Let's examine the precipitation data just obtained by `GPMpolyCentroid` over the White Oak Bayou study watershed.

```{r}

GPMpolyCentroid.precipitation.record <- system.file('extdata/GPMpolyCentroid',
                                                    'precipitation1.txt', 
                                                    package = 'NASAaccess')

GPMpolyCentroid.precipitation.data <- read.csv(GPMpolyCentroid.precipitation.record)

#since data started on 2019-08-01

days <- seq.Date(from = as.Date('2019-08-01'), 
                 length.out = dim(GPMpolyCentroid.precipitation.data)[1], by = 'day')

#plotting the precipitation time series

plot(days, GPMpolyCentroid.precipitation.data [,1], 
                                    pch = 19, ylab= '(mm)', 
                                    xlab = '', 
                                    type = 'b',
     main="White Oak Bayou Watershed precipitation (GPM)")
```


The time series plot above gives the rainfall amounts in (mm) at the centroid of the White Oak Bayou watershed during 2019-August-01 to 2019-August-03.



Last but not least, let's examine the near real time precipitation data obtained by `GPM_NRT` over the White Oak Bayou study watershed. Remember that the minimum latency for `GPM_NRT` is one day. You can experiment this function with yesterday data, nice! 
```{r,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

GPM_NRT(Dir = "./GPMswat/",
                  watershed = shape_path,
                  DEM = dem_path,
                  start = "2022-07-1",
                  end = "2022-07-3")

```



Let's see one point data record. See that the data starts on July 1, 2022 and ends on July 3rd, 2022 (It was raining near Houston, TX few days ago!!!)

```{r}
GPM_NRT.point.data <- system.file('extdata/GPM_NRT',
                              'precipitation2160845.txt', 
                              package = 'NASAaccess')

#Reading data records
read.csv(GPM_NRT.point.data)


```
